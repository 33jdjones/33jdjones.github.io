      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Jasmine Jones, and I am currently a junior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science.
        I chose this field because data is present in every situation, and I’ve always been driven by the need to understand the “why” behind patterns, decisions, and outcomes. 
        My long‑term goal is to become a data engineer, where I can build the systems and pipelines that make meaningful analysis possible.

      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school, I balance a full‑time job and life as a full‑time mom of three. In my free time, 
        I enjoy baking and taking on DIY projects anything that lets me be creative and hands‑on.

    Learning data science isn’t just about math, coding, or charts. It’s about understanding people and the choices they make. 
    Data comes from real people, real communities, and real systems. Because of that, it’s important to know what information is being collected, who is included, and who might be left out.

        </p>
        <p>
          When you study data science this way, you learn how to use data responsibly. Numbers don’t tell the full story on their own. They represent real lives and real decisions. To understand data correctly, you need to think about context, fairness, and the bigger picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many real-world problems, like issues in health care, education, and business, are shaped by human behavior and social systems. Looking at data with this understanding helps reduce bias, ask better questions, and make smarter, fairer decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a data science student juggling work, school, and family, I see how data-driven decisions can directly impact people’s lives. Learning data science with ethics in mind helps me think critically and create solutions that help people, not just look good on paper.
